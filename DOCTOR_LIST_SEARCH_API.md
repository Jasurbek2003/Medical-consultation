# Doctor List/Search API - Complete Guide

## üéØ Main Endpoint

```
GET /api/v1/doctors/list/
```

This is the **primary endpoint** for searching and listing doctors with:
- ‚úÖ Full search & filtering capabilities
- ‚úÖ Automatic search logging
- ‚úÖ Search limit enforcement (for unauthenticated users)
- ‚úÖ Automatic charging (for authenticated users)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting to prevent abuse

---

## üîí Rate Limits

| User Type | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| **Authenticated** | 60 requests/min |
| **Unauthenticated** | 20 requests/min |

**What happens when limit exceeded:**
```json
{
  "detail": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 45 seconds."
}
```
**Status Code**: 429 Too Many Requests

## üí∞ Charging System (Pay-Per-Visibility Model)

### How It Works

**DOCTORS pay for visibility** - When doctors appear in search results, they are charged for exposure:

1. **All Users (Authenticated & Unauthenticated)**: Free to search - no charges to users
2. **Doctors**: Charged when they appear in search results (advertising/visibility fee)

### Charging Rules

- ‚úÖ **Doctor is charged** when appearing in search results
- ‚úÖ Only charged **once per viewer per day** (per user or IP)
- ‚úÖ Charge amount set by each doctor individually (their "advertising budget")
- ‚úÖ Default: 0 (free) - doctors opt-in to paid visibility
- ‚úÖ Uses **doctor's wallet balance**
- ‚úÖ Automatic deduction from doctor's wallet
- ‚úÖ Tracked using DoctorViewCharge model

### Search Charges (Doctor Perspective)

Doctors pay for visibility when users search:

```python
# Doctor has configured search_charge = 1000 UZS
# When a user searches and this doctor appears in results:
# - First time this user/IP sees doctor today: Doctor charged 1000 UZS
# - Same user/IP later today: FREE (already charged for this viewer)
# - Tomorrow with same user/IP: Doctor charged 1000 UZS again (new day)
# - Different user/IP today: Doctor charged 1000 UZS (new viewer)
```

**Example:**
```
Doctor sets search_charge = 1000 UZS
Day 1: 50 unique viewers ‚Üí Doctor pays 50,000 UZS
Day 2: 30 returning + 20 new viewers ‚Üí Doctor pays 50,000 UZS (only new viewers count)
```

### How Doctors Set Charges

Doctors can configure their search charge:

```bash
# As a doctor, set your search charge
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/v1/doctors/charges/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token DOCTOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "search_charge": 1000,
    "view_card_charge": 2000,
    "view_phone_charge": 5000
  }'
```

### Check Doctor Wallet Balance

```bash
# Doctors: Check your wallet balance before configuring search charges
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/wallet/balance/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token DOCTOR_TOKEN"

# Response:
{
  "wallet": {
    "balance": 50000,
    "total_spent": 25000,
    "total_topped_up": 75000,
    "is_blocked": false
  }
}

# Doctors: Top up wallet if needed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/wallet/topup/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token DOCTOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100000}'
```

    {
      "id": 1,
      "user": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe"
      },
      "specialty": "kardiolog",
      "rating": 4.8,
      "consultation_price": 150000,
      "charges": {

        "view_card_charge": 2000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üö´ Search Limits (Unauthenticated Users)

Doctors can set daily search limits for unauthenticated users:

### How It Works

- Doctor sets `daily_search_limit = 50`
- Unauthenticated user can view this doctor **50 times per day** (per IP)
- After 50 views: Doctor is **hidden from search results**
- Next day: Limit resets

### Why You Might Not See Some Doctors

If you're searching without logging in and don't see many results, you may have hit search limits. **Sign in for unlimited access!**

```bash
# Sign in to bypass limits
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/auth/login/ \
  -d '{"username": "user", "password": "pass"}'

# Use token in subsequent requests
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/doctors/list/ \
  -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
```

    print(f"{i}. Dr. {doc['user']['last_name']} - {doc['rating']}‚≠ê ({doc['total_reviews']} reviews)")
```

### Example 3: Doctor Monitoring Visibility Costs

```python
# As a DOCTOR - Check your wallet balance and visibility spending

# Check current balance
wallet = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/payments/wallet/balance/',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Token DOCTOR_TOKEN'}
).json()

print(f"Doctor Wallet Balance: {wallet['wallet']['balance']} UZS")
print(f"Total Spent on Visibility: {wallet['wallet']['total_spent']} UZS")

# Check your search charge settings
charges = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/doctors/charges/',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Token DOCTOR_TOKEN'}
).json()

print(f"Your search_charge: {charges['search_charge']} UZS per viewer")

# View your charge logs (who viewed you)
logs = requests.get(
    'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/doctors/charge-logs/?charge_type=search',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Token DOCTOR_TOKEN'}
).json()

print(f"Recent visibility charges: {logs['count']} viewers today")
for log in logs['results'][:5]:
    print(f"  - {log['user_name'] or 'Anonymous'}: {log['amount']} UZS")
```

### Example 4: Handle Rate Limiting

    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        response = requests.get(
            'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/doctors/list/',
            params=params
        )

        if response.status_code == 429:
            retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
            print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {retry_after} seconds...")
            time.sleep(retry_after)
            continue

        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()

        raise Exception(f"Error: {response.status_code}")

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")

# Usage
doctors = search_with_retry({'specialty': 'kardiolog'})
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Responses

### 429 - Too Many Requests (Rate Limit)

```json
{
  "detail": "Request was throttled. Expected available in 45 seconds."
}
```

**Solution**: Wait and retry, or sign in for higher limits

### 402 - Payment Required (Insufficient Balance) - FOR DOCTORS

```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient wallet balance"
}
```

**Who sees this**: Doctors when their wallet balance is too low for visibility charges
**Solution**: Top up your doctor wallet at `/api/v1/payments/wallet/topup/`
**Note**: Doctors with insufficient balance will still appear in search, but won't be charged

### 400 - Bad Request

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid filter parameter"
}
```

**Solution**: Check your filter values

## üìà Cost Management (For Doctors)

### How Doctors Can Manage Visibility Costs

1. **Set Reasonable search_charge**: Start low (500-1000 UZS) and adjust based on ROI
2. **Monitor Daily Spending**: Check charge logs daily to track costs
3. **Set Budget Limits**: Top up wallet with controlled amounts
4. **Analyze Viewer Demographics**: Review who's viewing to optimize targeting
5. **Adjust Based on Demand**: Increase charge during slow periods, decrease during high demand
6. **Disable When Fully Booked**: Set search_charge = 0 when you can't take new patients

### Doctor Visibility Cost Examples

If doctor sets search_charge = 1000 UZS:

| Scenario | Cost to Doctor | Revenue Potential |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 50 unique viewers/day | 50,000 UZS/day | If 5% convert = 2-3 bookings |
| 100 unique viewers/day | 100,000 UZS/day | If 5% convert = 5 bookings |
| 20 returning + 30 new viewers | 30,000 UZS/day | Repeat viewers = no charge |
| Set search_charge = 0 | 0 UZS/day | Free visibility |

**ROI Calculation Example:**
```
Daily visibility cost: 50,000 UZS (50 viewers √ó 1,000 UZS)
Conversion rate: 5% (2.5 bookings)
Consultation fee: 150,000 UZS
Daily revenue: 375,000 UZS
Net profit: 325,000 UZS (6.5x ROI)
```

**Note**: Most doctors set search_charge = 0 to maximize exposure

3. **Keep Wallet Funded**: Ensure sufficient balance for continuous visibility
4. **Review Logs**: Check `/api/v1/doctors/charge-logs/` for viewer insights
5. **Adjust Dynamically**: Change search_charge based on booking capacity

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Request was throttled"
**Cause**: Rate limit exceeded (20/min for guests, 60/min for users)
**Solution**: Wait 60 seconds or sign in

### Issue: Few/No results when searching
**Cause**: You may have hit search limits on popular doctors
**Solution**: Sign in to bypass limits

### Issue: "Insufficient wallet balance"
**Cause**: Not enough funds for search charges
**Solution**: Top up wallet at `/api/v1/payments/wallet/topup/`
